# Code of Conduct

We value the participation of every member of the scientific community and want to ensure that every 
participant and collaborator has a positive, educational experience unhindered by unneccesary challenges caused by 
non-inclusive behavior. Accordingly, everyone who participates in this summer school is expected to show respect and 
courtesy to other community members at all times.
The organizers of the summer school and all the participants are dedicated to a ***harassment and discrimination-free 
experience for everyone.*** Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, 
religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, 
dis/ability status, appearance or body size will not be tolerated.  
**We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form**. 
We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious PhDs, people who are looking to learn and develop 
their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past. 

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Please make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* Watch out for [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.

Unacceptable behavior includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, 
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, 
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, 
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

***Participants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately.***

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the summer school, 
or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by the organizers. 
If inappropriate behaviour persists after a discussion with them, the issue will be escalated according to procedures 
laid out by the relevant entities in the corresponding school (EPFL or ETHZ). 

**To report an issue** please contact [the organizers](mailto:rcs18@ethz.ch). All communication will be treated as confidential.
